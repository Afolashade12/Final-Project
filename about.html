        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Have you ever felt drawn to a place you’ve never been? Mecca has always called to me, 
		  and this site is how I bring that journey closer.”
        </p>
        <p>
          As someone deeply passionate about growth and purpose, I created this website not just to fulfill an assignment, but to express my values, vision, and voice. I’m Ameenah Adeniran, and I major in Computer Science. But beyond the lectures, labs, and long lines of code, I’m someone with big dreams and a heart that yearns for something deeper.
        </p>
        <p>
          Choosing Mecca as the focus of this site was personal. It’s not just a place on a map, it’s a destination my soul longs for. I imagine myself standing there someday, overwhelmed with peace and awe. Creating this project brought me closer to that dream, one image, one scroll effect, one spiritual reflection at a time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Of course, it hasn’t all been smooth. Balancing school, work, and personal life feels like assembling IKEA furniture without the manual. There have been stressful nights and moments I wanted to give up. But every challenge has helped me grow in patience, resilience, and self-belief.
        </p>
        <p>
          This journey  is about becoming: becoming a better student, a stronger woman, a more faithful soul, and a person who creates with intention. I’m learning to manage my time, lean into discomfort, and pour my heart into everything I do. 
        </p>
        <p>
          And yes, if you see a breathtaking background slowly sliding across your screen that was on purpose. Every part of this site was chosen to reflect beauty, serenity, and my connection to something greater.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thank you for stopping by. Let this page remind you that growth may be messy, but that mess holds golden meaning.It’s where change happens. Below this screen is someone who refuses to settle; she's chasing progress, purpose, and peace with relentless determination. 
		  And if her journey can inspire even one step forward for you, then nothing here was wasted. </p>
