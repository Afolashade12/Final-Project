        Mecca, located in modern-day Saudi Arabia, is the holiest city in Islam and a destination of profound spiritual reverence. It is the birthplace of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) and the site of the Kaaba, the sacred cube-shaped structure located at the center of Masjid al-Haram. The Kaaba, according to Islamic belief, was originally built by the Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) and his son Isma’il (Ishmael) as a sanctuary devoted to the worship of the one true God.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even before the advent of Islam, the Kaaba served as a revered sanctuary. Tradition holds that the structure was initially a simple, roofless rectangle. Around 608 C.E., the Quraysh tribe, who were guardians of Mecca at the time, undertook a reconstruction of the Kaaba using alternating courses of stone and wood. To safeguard the shrine from floods and unauthorized access, they raised its entrance above ground level—a feature that remains to this day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through the centuries, Mecca has preserved its sanctity and evolved into a spiritual center for Muslims worldwide. It continues to witness millions of faithful pilgrims who travel to perform Hajj and Umrah, maintaining its timeless role as the spiritual heart of Islam.
